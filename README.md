* **NOTE:**
    > Node version used: `v16.14.2`
    
    > Recommended version: `<= v18.0.0`
    > * Download link: <https://nodejs.org/dist/v17.0.0/>

* To initialise the project:
    1. Make sure node is installed. `node -v`
    2. Make sure npm is installed as well. `npm -v`
    3. Install expo globally just to be sure: `npm install --global expo-cli`
    4. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
    5. Start project: `npx expo start`

* If at some point you run into this error:
    > Some dependencies are incompatible with the installed expo package version:
    > * The fix is: `npx expo install --fix`
  
    > The above error could result from differing versions to that of expo.

* Goodluck!!!
